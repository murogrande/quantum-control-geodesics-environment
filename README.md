# Quantum Control scheme using the geodesic of the density matrices manifold

This is my master thesis with a Mathematica notebook of an example of the code. 

In general terms, we present a quantum control esqueme that concerns the geodesic of the density matrices manifold and the Bures metric. The work will in the folder "mater-thesis".

### This work is an on going task thus we are still devoping

At the moment, we are adding the environment in reckons and we are working with the Limblad master equation in order to add the environment. Stay tune for the article and the code.
